# Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement learning (RL) is a machine learning paradigm where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with its environment and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties. Through trial and error, the agent improves its strategies to maximize long-term rewards, enabling it to solve complex tasks autonomously. RL is important because it powers advancements in areas such as robotics, game playing, and autonomous systems, offering a framework for developing intelligent systems that can adapt and improve over time.

### Taxi Problem
The "taxi problem" is a classic example of reinforcement learning, where the goal is to train an agent (the taxi) to pick up passengers from one location and drop them off at their destination within a grid-like environment. The taxi navigates between different locations while avoiding obstacles, and at each step, it receives rewards for correct actions (like successful pickups and drop-offs) or penalties for incorrect ones (such as illegal moves or going off-grid). This problem demonstrates how RL enables the taxi agent to learn an optimal policy for navigating the environment efficiently, minimizing the number of steps taken and maximizing rewards.

In this section, we aim to address the problem using two renowned algorithms: Monte Carlo and Q-Learning. These approaches are fundamental in reinforcement learning, offering distinct methods for optimizing decision-making processes. By leveraging these algorithms, we will explore how each can be applied to solve the given problem, highlighting their strengths and differences in strategy development.
In this example, the libraries Gymnasium, NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib are used. All code is written in the Jupyter Notebook platform.


- The Monte Carlo Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm estimates the value of an action or state by averaging returns from multiple episodes that reach the target state, allowing it to improve decision-making over time. Unlike other RL methods, Monte Carlo requires complete episodes, which makes it effective but sometimes limited in environments where episodes are lengthy or rarely reach terminal states.
