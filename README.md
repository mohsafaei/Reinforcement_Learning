# Reinforcement_Learning

Reinforcement learning (RL) is a machine learning paradigm where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with its environment and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties. Through trial and error, the agent improves its strategies to maximize long-term rewards, enabling it to solve complex tasks autonomously. RL is important because it powers advancements in areas such as robotics, game playing, and autonomous systems, offering a framework for developing intelligent systems that can adapt and improve over time.

The "taxi problem" is a classic example of reinforcement learning, where the goal is to train an agent (the taxi) to pick up passengers from one location and drop them off at their destination within a grid-like environment. The taxi navigates between different locations while avoiding obstacles, and at each step, it receives rewards for correct actions (like successful pickups and drop-offs) or penalties for incorrect ones (such as illegal moves or going off-grid). This problem demonstrates how RL enables the taxi agent to learn an optimal policy for navigating the environment efficiently, minimizing the number of steps taken and maximizing rewards.
